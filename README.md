# CyberPong
CyberPong - Ping Pong Exersice Mashine

### About

This is the Ping Pong Exersice Machine that Uses 4 DC Motors and in order to shoot out ping pong balls with different spins.

### What is used in the Project:

**PSOC 4200 BLE(CY8CKIT-042-BLE-A to be exact)**
- programed via _PSOC Creator_

**RoHS 18152522 R DC Motors**
- Each one has VCC and GND, and an encoder with VCC, GND and Output that tells the actual motor speed.
- 4 of them are used.
- Power supply is **12V** and max RPM is ~**4350** with that power.

**L298N Motor Driver**

- 2.5 of them are used.
- 2 power the motors and the other half powers the serving motor.

**JGA25-370 DC Motow with a reducer**

- Responsible for serving the ball, can work with **5V** as well as **12V**

**Light deflection sensor**

- Determines whether the ball flew out of the machine.

**Some 12V power supply(We used S-360-12)**

### Detailed information

The goal of this project was to measure, how good such a machine can serve ping pong balls. It needs to be precise, hence the **PID Algorithm** was used in order to make motor speeds as stable as possible.

We used the built in **Fan Controller** Component in order to implement PID:

- Our coefficients turned out to be **P - 100%**, **I - 80%** and **D - 20%**. _This is still to be perfected though._

The overall program has **2 modes**:
- **Automatic**
- **Manual**

**Automatic mode** randomly shoots out balls with different spins, taken from a predefined config. It also serves the balls automatically.

**Manual mode** gives the user the possibility to set and monitor the speeds of each independant motor and control the serving.
